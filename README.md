# Python


I discovered programming by Python on [OpenClassRooms](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/courses/235344-apprenez-a-programmer-en-python).
Today I learn what it takes to become a fullstack develeoper. I choose to include my TP in my [website](https://truong-terence.github.io/Portfolio.github.io/). Just hit RUN :)
